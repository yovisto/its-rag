This is a Proof of Concept (POC) for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge retrieval. The system combines information retrieval techniques with generative AI to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and contextually relevant responses.
